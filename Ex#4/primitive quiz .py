## Exercise 4: Primitive Quiz - 30 Marks

In this exercise, you'll create a simple program that asks the user a question, evaluates their answer, and provides feedback.

### Steps:
1. Write a program that asks the user "What is the capital of France?" and waits for their response.
2. If the user's answer is correct (i.e., "Paris"), the program should print a message saying the answer is correct.
3. If the answer is incorrect, the program should print a message saying the answer is wrong.

# Ask the user the question
country = input("what is the capital of France?")

# Check if the answer is correct
if country.strip().lower() == "paris":
    print("the answer is correct.")
else:
    print("the answer is wrong.")
